•Implemented a deep learning project focused on image classification of commonly used urban buildings using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and GoogleNet transfer learning. The dataset comprised various urban structures, and the goal was to accurately classify images into specific building categories. Employed transfer learning techniques with the GoogleNet architecture to leverage pre-trained features, enhancing model performance.

•Executed training and fine-tuning processes on the CNN model, optimizing it for the specific task. The model demonstrated robust classification capabilities, achieving an overall accuracy of 89.5% across multiple building categories. The project addressed challenges related to urban landscapes and diverse architectural styles, showcasing the effectiveness of transfer learning in handling real-world image classification tasks.

This project was designed from my deep-learning course. We construct a CNN model with the aid of transfer learning to corretly indentify common land-use structure from a city satellite map.
